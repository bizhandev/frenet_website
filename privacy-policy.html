  <h1>Privacy Policy for Frenet</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 01 September 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you use <strong>Frenet</strong> mobile app, including our integrations with the Pinterest API. This document is intended for business users of the app. It is not legal advice.</p>

  <h2>1) What this policy covers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Our processing of data obtained via Pinterest API for <strong>organic</strong> and <strong>paid</strong> analytics (Pins, campaigns, ad accounts, and related performance metrics).</li>
    <li>Basic account information you provide to set up and access the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>We do not sell personal data.</strong></p>

  <h2>2) Data we collect</h2>
  <h3>From Pinterest (via API, with your authorization):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Account and object identifiers (e.g., user/account IDs, board IDs, pin IDs, ad account/campaign/ad group/ad IDs).</li>
    <li>Analytics/metrics and reporting dimensions (e.g., impressions, clicks, CTR, saves, conversions, spend, revenue/ROAS where available, dates, granularity).</li>
    <li>Limited profile information needed to operate the connection (e.g., account name).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>From you (directly):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact details (name, email) for admin use.</li>
    <li>OAuth tokens/refresh tokens required to access the Pinterest API on your behalf.</li>
    <li>Configuration settings (e.g., time zones, report presets).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive categories of personal data.</p>

  <h2>3) How we use the data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate with Pinterest and fetch organic and paid analytics you request.</li>
    <li>To generate dashboards and reports for your internal use.</li>
    <li>To provide support, troubleshooting, usage analytics (non-identifying), and to improve the app.</li>
    <li>To comply with Pinterest Developer policies and applicable law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Legal bases (EEA/UK):</em> legitimate interests in providing analytics tooling; performance of a contract where applicable; and/or your consent where required.</p>

  <h2>4) Data sharing & disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not share your data with third parties except:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers (sub-processors)</strong> under contract (e.g., cloud hosting, monitoring, error logging) — access only to perform services and with appropriate protections.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal</strong> requirements (e.g., subpoena) or to protect rights, safety, or prevent abuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Pinterest</strong> — data flows to/from Pinterest strictly via API under your authorization; we follow Pinterest Terms and Platform Policies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A current list of sub-processors is available on request: <a href="mailto:info@frenet-company.com">info@frenet-company.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>5) Data storage, location & retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data and tokens are stored in secure cloud infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Access is limited to authorized personnel under least-privilege controls.</li>
    <li>OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest; all network traffic uses TLS.</li>
    <li>We keep report data for <strong>6 months</strong> unless you request earlier deletion or a different retention period is agreed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Your choices & rights</h2>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p><em>EEA/UK users:</em> you may have rights to restrict processing, portability, and to object; you can lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.<br>
  <em>California residents:</em> we do not “sell” personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. You may request access or deletion as above.</p>

  <h2>7) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>Our services are intended for business use and are not directed to children under 13.</p>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data. No method is 100% secure; we strive to continuously improve.</p>

  <h2>9) International transfers</h2>
  <p>If we transfer data across borders, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses or other lawful mechanisms). Details on request.</p>

  <h2>10) Changes to this policy</h2>
